## Introduction

This project implements a decentralized property rental system using blockchain technology. It allows property owners to list their properties for rent, and tenants to rent these properties using cryptocurrency transactions. The system includes features such as security deposits, ratings for both properties and users, and automated lease management.

## Features

- Property listing and management
- Secure rental transactions with cryptocurrency
- Automated security deposit handling
- User and property rating system
- Lease duration tracking
- Platform fee collection
- Decentralized and transparent operations

## Smart Contract Overview

The smart contract is written in Clarity, a decidable smart contract language designed for use with the Stacks blockchain. It includes the following key components:

- Data structures for storing property and user information
- Functions for property management (adding, updating, renting)
- Lease management (starting and ending leases)
- Rating system for properties and users
- Read-only functions for retrieving information

## Getting Started

To use this smart contract, you'll need:

1. A Stacks wallet (e.g., Hiro Wallet)
2. STX tokens for transaction fees and rentals
3. Access to a Stacks blockchain node

(Add specific instructions for setting up the development environment, deploying the contract, etc.)

## Usage

### For Property Owners

1. Initialize the contract (only done once by the contract owner)
2. Add your property using the `add-property` function
3. Update property details as needed with `update-property`
4. Receive rental payments and manage your properties

### For Tenants

1. Browse available properties (use `get-property-details`)
2. Rent a property using the `rent-property` function
3. End your lease when appropriate with `end-lease`
4. Rate properties and users after your stay

## Functions

### Public Functions

- `initialize`: Set up the contract with a platform fee percentage
- `add-property`: List a new property for rent
- `update-property`: Modify details of an existing property
- `rent-property`: Rent an available property
- `end-lease`: Terminate a lease and return the security deposit
- `rate-property`: Rate a property after staying
- `rate-user`: Rate another user (tenant or owner)

### Read-Only Functions

- `get-property-details`: Retrieve information about a specific property
- `get-user-rating`: Get the average rating for a user
- `get-total-properties`: Get the total number of properties listed
- `get-remaining-lease-time`: Check the remaining time on an active lease
- `is-initialized`: Check if the contract has been initialized

## Security Considerations

- The contract includes access control to ensure only authorized users can perform certain actions
- Security deposits are held by the contract and automatically returned when a lease ends
- User funds are protected by requiring sufficient balance before allowing rentals
- Rating system helps build trust in the platform
